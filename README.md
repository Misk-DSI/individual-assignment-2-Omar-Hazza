## This repo contains:

- data: which contains winequality-red.csv file that we work with.

- scr: a source folder that contains wine_EDA.R and wine_report.Rmd.

- wine_report.html

## The results:

After obtaining this data and apply several statistical concepts through R, and study the relations between many factors in the wine industry, we conclude that the quality of the red wine is highly related to the percentage of alcohol in it, which is quite reasonable.
